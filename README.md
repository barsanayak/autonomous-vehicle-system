# Autonomous-vehicle-system

A Simulation toolkit for Modeling and Simulation of Resource Management Techniques in Internet of Things, Edge and Fog Computing Environments for Autnomous Vehicle System


# Steps to Autonomous-vehicle-syste 
* Create a Java project in Eclipse.   
* Inside the project directory, initialize an empty Git repository with the following command. 
```
git init
```
  
* Add the Git repository of autonomous-vehicle-system as the origin remote.  
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/barsanayak/autonomous-vehicle-system.git
```
* Pull the contents of the repository to your machine.  
```
git pull origin master
```
* Include the JARs (except the CloudSim ones) to your Eclipse project.  

* Run the class "AutnomousVehicleSystem" as  Java Application  
* On recieving the output, various required values can be used for analysis  


* Parameters and Configuration:  
  
1. For Cloud computing values , CLOUD = true  
   For Fog Computing values, CLOUD = false;  

2. To vary the number of vehicles, vary the following parameters  
	numOfFogDeviceArea   
	numOfVehiclesPerFogDeviceCoverage  
  
  ## Input Parameters
